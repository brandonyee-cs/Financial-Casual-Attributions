Key findings from the report:

## Key Findings

1. **Xgboost performs best**: Our experiments show that Xgboost provides the most causally faithful explanations across financial scenarios.

2. **XGBOOST models yield more causally accurate attributions**: XGBOOST models demonstrated superior ability to generate attributions that align with true causal structure.

3. **Fraud detection presents unique challenges**: Indirect indicators (consequences of fraud) often receive substantial attribution weight despite not being causal drivers.

4. **Multiple attribution methods recommended**: Significant variability in performance across methods suggests using multiple techniques for robust understanding.

5. **Caution needed when interpreting attributions as causal**: Our findings underscore that feature attributions should not be naively interpreted as causal explanations without domain expertise and proper validation.
