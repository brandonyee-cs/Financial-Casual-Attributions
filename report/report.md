### Observations on Causal Feature Identification

- **Easiest Scenario for Identifying Causal Features**: Credit Risk
- **Most Challenging Scenario for Identifying Causal Features**: Asset Pricing

### Fraud Detection Insights

The fraud detection scenario presents unique challenges for attribution methods due to the presence of indirect indicators (consequences of fraud) that are highly correlated with fraud events but are not causal. These indirect indicators often receive substantial attribution weight from models even though they are effects rather than causes of fraud, highlighting a key challenge in causal feature attribution.

### Practical Recommendations

Based on these findings, practitioners in financial domains should:

1. **Use Shap for Financial Models**: When causal understanding is crucial, Shap provides the most reliable feature attributions that align with true causal relationships.

2. **Consider XGBOOST Models**: These models demonstrated the best overall alignment between feature importance and true causal relationships in our experiments.

3. **Exercise Caution with Asset Pricing-like Scenarios**: Attribution methods struggle most with identifying causal features in Asset Pricing contexts. Additional domain expertise should be incorporated when interpreting model explanations in these areas.

4. **Verify Attributions with Multiple Methods**: The variability in performance across attribution methods suggests that cross-validation with multiple techniques can provide a more robust understanding of causal relationships in financial models.

## Conclusion

This report has presented a comprehensive analysis of the causal faithfulness of various feature attribution methods across different financial machine learning models and scenarios. The results highlight both the strengths and limitations of current attribution techniques in identifying true causal relationships, with important implications for model explainability, regulatory compliance, and decision-making in financial contexts.

The findings underscore the need for practitioners to exercise caution when interpreting feature attributions as causal explanations and suggest avenues for developing more causally-aware interpretability frameworks in finance.
