## Conclusion

This report has presented a comprehensive analysis of the causal faithfulness of various feature attribution methods across different financial machine learning models and scenarios. The results highlight both the strengths and limitations of current attribution techniques in identifying true causal relationships, with important implications for model explainability, regulatory compliance, and decision-making in financial contexts.

The findings underscore the need for practitioners to exercise caution when interpreting feature attributions as causal explanations and suggest avenues for developing more causally-aware interpretability frameworks in finance.
